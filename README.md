**[Senior Migration, Local Economic Development and Spatial Concentration](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34725)**

**Authors**: Marco A. Badilla Maroto, Benjamin Faber, Antoine B. Levy, Mathilde Muñoz

**Abstract**: We document that migration flows upon retirement are predominantly from richer, more urban to poorer, more rural regions. In theory, the local economic implications of senior in-migration are ambiguous, while empirically there is little existing evidence on whether attracting mobile seniors can be an effective tool to promote economic development among lagging regions. We combine a unique collection of microdata from France with a new empirical strategy to fill this gap. We find that senior inflows have significant positive effects on the local economy over the course of a decade, including increases in the working-age population, total employment, GDP, average incomes, fiscal revenues and housing construction. These effects are particularly pronounced among initially poorer regions. They are accompanied by an increase in the share of services in the local economy, driven by employment growth in health, food services and retail sectors. Combining these estimates with observed region-to-region net migration flows, we find that mobile seniors have become a significant force for reducing the concentration of employment and GDP across regions.

**[Technology and Economic Development](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34730)**

**Authors**: Daron Acemoglu, Ufuk Akcigit, Simon Johnson

**Abstract**: This chapter presents a tractable framework for the study of technology adoption and diffusion in the context of economic development. Firms in countries behind the world technology frontier can rapidly adopt new techniques from the world frontier. Lower absorptive capacity (because of weak education systems, poor management practices, or barriers to technology adoption), institutional distortions, mismatch between frontier technologies and the needs of firms in the country (i.e., “inappropriate technology”), and credit market frictions slow down technology adoption and cause the economy in question to have a greater distance to the frontier and thus lower income per capita—although the long-run growth rate of the country still remains equal to that of the frontier. This framework is extended to study the choice between innovation and imitation, as well as the role of selection for higher-productivity and higher-absorptive capacity firms during the process of economic development. We illustrate the main comparative statics of our framework with a number of correlations based on cross-country and firm-level data. The tractability of the framework makes it amenable to a range of additional extensions.

**[The Contribution of College Majors to Gender and Racial Earnings Differences](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34726)**

**Authors**: Scott A. Imberman, Michael F. Lovenheim, Patrick Massey, Kevin M. Stange, Rodney J. Andrews

**Abstract**: Gender and racial/ethnic gaps in labor market earnings remain large, even among college-goers. Cross-gender and race/ethnic differences in choice of and returns to college major are potentially important contributors. Following Texas public high school graduates for up to 20 years through college and the labor market, we assess gender and racial differences in college major choices and the consequences of these choices. Women and underrepresented minorities are less likely than men, Whites, and Asians to major in high earning fields like business, economics, engineering, and computer science, however we also show that they experience lower returns to these majors. Differences in major-specific returns relative to liberal arts explain about one quarter of the gender, White-Black, and White-Hispanic (but not White-Asian) earnings gaps among four-year college students and become larger contributors to earnings gaps than differential major distributions as workers age. We present suggestive evidence that differences in occupation choices within field are a key driver of the differences in returns across groups. The work shines light on the roles that college major choice and returns by gender and race contribute to inequality.

**[Rational Disagreement](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34727)**

**Authors**: Nabil Al-Najjar, Harald Uhlig

**Abstract**: We propose rational disagreement as a formal framework for analyzing seemingly irrational behavior that can persist despite the wide availability of objective information in a steady-state. Agents are rational in that they correctly anticipate the distribution of aggregate outcomes, yet disagree about which specific individuals perform better than others. Notably, the subjective belief of any individual may be objectively correct. We illustrate the key concepts with a simple entry game. We show how unordered individual outcome distributions can be identified solely from aggregate statistics. We then characterize the resulting game, define its Nash equilibria, and develop a statistical test for the null hypothesis of agreement. Finally, we situate our framework within the broader literature on Bayesian games, behavioral biases, and the rational expectations hypothesis.

**[Global Trade, Tariff Uncertainty and the U.S. Dollar](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34728)**

**Authors**: Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Can Soylu, Muhammed A. Yildirim

**Abstract**: We analyze how tariff uncertainty affects exchange rates, motivated by the U.S. dollar’s depreciation after the 2025 tariff announcements. Standard macro-trade models predict that unilateral tariffs appreciate the implementing country’s currency, but we show this result can be overturned by policy uncertainty. We build a two-country general equilibrium model with risk-averse agents and segmented financial markets, where tariff volatility enters uncovered interest parity through a risk-premium wedge. Higher tariff uncertainty increases precautionary savings and risk premia, leading to immediate currency depreciation even as tariffs rise. Quantitatively, the model replicates the size and timing of the observed dollar depreciation episode dynamics.

**[No Taxation Without Administration: Bringing The State Back Into The Public Finance Of Developing Countries](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34729)**

**Authors**: Anders Jensen, Jonathan L. Weigel

**Abstract**: The empirical economics literature on taxation in developing countries has centered on the importance of third-party information for enforcement. Yet, while surely a long-run objective, leveraging such information remains out of reach in many developing countries due to largely informal economies and low state capacity. This article examines an emerging complementary literature focused on strengthening the 'sinews' of state capacity: tax administration. We argue that reforms to the organizational structure, personnel management, and task management of tax authorities have potential to raise tax capacity in developing countries. We also argue that efforts to improve the state's legitimacy – popular acceptance of its right to tax – can increase capacity and may complement investments in tax administration. Our approach bridges a long-standing divide between how scholars in public finance and political economy approach tax capacity building in developing countries.

**[Salience and the Elasticity of Taxable Income: Evidence from Top-bracket Tax Reforms](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34731)**

**Authors**: Xavier Dufour, Pierre-Carl Michaud, Michael G. Smart

**Abstract**: We estimate heterogeneous responses to top-bracket tax reforms using a triple-difference design that exploits variation in tax rate changes and the thresholds at which they apply. This strategy identifies behavioral responses even in the presence of unobservable shocks to the income distribution. Higher-income taxpayers respond more to top-rate changes, but our results indicate that this reflects the salience of the reforms—the larger mechanical change in average tax rates at higher incomes—rather than heterogeneity in substitution elasticities. We discuss implications for the revenue and distributional effects of top-bracket tax reforms.

**[The Twenty-four Hour Economy or Rolled-up Sidewalks: Trends in Work Timing and Their Causes](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34732)**

**Authors**: Jeff Biddle, Daniel S. Hamermesh

**Abstract**: We demonstrate nearly steady trends from 1973-2023 in the U.S. in the timing of when people work for pay, away from evening and night hours toward “usual” daytime hours. The trend is related to changes in rising educational attainment, to increased real incomes, and the increased wage premium for undesirable work times—evenings and nights—that we document. The trend exists in all major industries except retail, in which changes in technology biased work away from daytime hours. The trend was accelerated by the sharp increase in telework that occurred after the Covid pandemic, an increase that was especially concentrated during daytime hours. While we observe the same phenomenon in France from 1966 to 2010, we do not in the U.K. from 1974-2015, arguably because of the very sharp decline in unionization in the U.K. and the changes in retailing.

**[Does Generative AI Crowd Out Human Creators? Evidence from Pixiv](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34733)**

**Authors**: Sueyoul Kim, Ginger Zhe Jin, Eungik Lee

**Abstract**: Using a comprehensive dataset of posts from a major platform for anime- and manga-style artwork, we study the impact of the launch of a prominent text-to-image generative AI. Focusing on the majority of incumbent creators who do not adopt AI as a primary tool, we show that the AI launch led to a significant decline in post uploads by illustrators, whereas comic artists were less affected, reflecting the need for tight stylistic alignment across sequential images in comics. We present empirical evidence for two underlying mechanisms. First, illustration posts experience a loss of viewer attention, measured by bookmarks, following the AI launch, which can significantly harm creators’ business models. Second, direct competition from AI-generated content plays an important role: illustrators working on intellectual properties (IPs, such as Pokémon) that are more heavily invaded by AI reduce their uploads disproportionately more. We further examine creators’ responses and show that illustrators with greater exposure to AI avoid using tags favored by AI-generated content after the AI launch and broaden the range of IPs they work on, consistent with a risk-hedging response to AI invasion.

**[War and Democratic Backsliding](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34734)**

**Authors**: Efraim Benmelech, Joao Monteiro

**Abstract**: We provide the first global, long-run evidence on how war reshapes democratic institutions. Using data on all conflicts since 1948, we show that the onset of conflict causes a large and persistent decline in democracy: institutions weaken immediately, continue to erode for nearly a decade, and do not recover. Yet this deterioration is highly selective. It appears only in first-time conflicts, intrastate wars, highly fractionalized societies, and conflicts that governments win. The decline operates through political channels – media censorship, judicial purges, curtailed civil liberties, irregular leadership turnover, and constitutional suspensions - rather than through any functional requirement of war-making. Autocratization does not increase the probability of victory, and institutional instability reduces it. Taken together, the findings show that war does not require autocracy; it enables executives to expand their authority and implement institutional changes that would be difficult to enact in peacetime.

**[Economic Development and the Environment](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34735)**

**Authors**: B. Kelsey Jack, Nicholas Ryan

**Abstract**: Economic development relies on and transforms the environment. The transformation is evident in the poor environmental quality in many developing countries. For example, air quality in Southeast Asia is three times worse than in the United States, in sub-Saharan Africa four times worse and in South Asia more than six times worse. We model how environmental quality affects health, productivity and well-being and how individuals privately adapt to environmental hazards. We also model how collective action and formal regulation contribute to environmental quality. We draw three main findings from a review of empirical research on these mechanisms. First, individual adaptation to environmental hazards is both inadequate as a remedy and inefficiently low. Second, collective action, without the state, to manage resources or address externalities has been outstripped by the scale of environmental problems. Third, state action through formal regulation works better than it looks. Many formal regulations are coarse, poorly targeted and inefficient, but nonetheless yield benefits in excess of their costs.

**[College Major Choice, Payoffs, and Gender Gaps](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34736)**

**Authors**: Christopher Campos, Pablo Muñoz, Alonso Bucarey, Dante Contreras

**Abstract**: This paper studies how college major choices shape earnings and fertility outcomes. Using administrative data that link students' preferences, random assignment to majors, and post-college outcomes, we estimate the causal pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns to different fields of study. We document substantial heterogeneity in these returns across majors and show that such variation helps explain gender gaps in labor market outcomes: women place greater weight on balancing career and family in their major choices, and these preference differences account for about 30% of the gender earnings gap among college graduates. Last, we use our causal estimates to evaluate the effects of counterfactual assignment rules that target representation gaps in settings with centralized assignment systems. We find that gender quotas in high-return fields can significantly reduce representation and earnings gaps with minimal impacts on efficiency and aggregate fertility.

**[Measuring the Growth of Skills](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34737)**

**Authors**: James J. Heckman, Haihan Tian, Jin Zhou, Zijian Zhang

**Abstract**: This paper discusses a fundamental problem in measuring the growth of knowledge and comparing the skills of people. New skills emerge that are not just more of the previously acquired skills. Psychometric convention forces these skills into arbitrarily constructed scales, which can severely distort measurement. To formally address this problem, we measure skills using a novel measurement scheme, estimate a stochastic learning process and reject the common scale assumption across levels for language and cognitive skills. Furthermore, we estimate dynamic complementarity without imposing arbitrary scales for skills.

**[The Informational Role of Emission Markets: Prices vs Quantities with Dispersed Information About Externalities](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34738)**

**Authors**: Derek Lemoine

**Abstract**: I study asymmetric information about the social cost of an externality, as opposed to asymmetric information about private costs of abatement. I show that quantity regulation with bankable permits has an informational advantage because the permit market aggregates dispersed information about social costs. It has the disadvantage of making private costs more uncertain ex ante. I analytically derive the expression for the (dis)advantage of prices over quantities in this setting. I show that a quantity policy can dominate a price policy for any slope of marginal private costs and always dominates when marginal private costs are sufficiently flat.

**[The Dynamics of Retail Deposit Balances](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34742)**

**Authors**: Bronson Argyle, Benjamin Iverson, Jason D. Kotter, Taylor D. Nadauld, Christopher Palmer

**Abstract**: We investigate the dynamics of household deposits using account-level data from 12 million accounts across 154 U.S. credit unions. Significant skewness in the retail deposit distribution–with 10% of depositors controlling 70% of total deposits–means large-balance accounts drive aggregate retail deposit flows. On average, high-balance accounts become large after significant one-time inflows and are more likely to experience large, idiosyncratic drawdowns. Unlike low-balance households, high-balance retail depositors are not sensitive to interest rate shocks. Additional evidence suggests that overall retail deposit stickiness is driven by high-balance accounts that are used as medium-run liquidity stores rather than for interest income.

**[The Demand for Grandchildren: Children as Family Public Goods and Implications for Cooperative Bargaining](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34741)**

**Authors**: Janice Compton, Robert A. Pollak

**Abstract**: The title says it all. Well, almost all. To economists, the situation suggests bargaining between parents and grandparents, where the grandparents can "bribe" the parents to have more children or to have children sooner than they otherwise would. Because cash transfers seem inappropriate, bribes are likely to take the form of promises of child care or down payments on houses. Coasian bargaining or, more generally, cooperative bargaining models with their explicit assumption of Pareto efficiency offer accessible off-the shelf models. Larger family size (e.g., the participation of both pairs of grandparents) and family complexity (e.g., resulting from divorce and repartnering in the parents' generation or the grandparents' generation) threaten the assumption of zero or low transaction costs. Low transaction costs, explicit in the Coasian analysis and implicit in cooperative game theory's assumption of Pareto efficiency, play a crucial role. The generalization of family economics from the analysis of bargaining between spouses to include family members beyond the household will at some point require replacing Coasian and cooperative bargaining with models of noncooperative bargaining.

**[Consumer Demand and Market Competition with Time-Intensive Goods](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34743)**

**Authors**: Joseph Goodman, Lancelot Henry de Frahan, Justin E. Holz, John A. List, Niall MacMenamin, Evan C. McKay, Magne Mogstad, Sally Sadoff, Hal Sider

**Abstract**: We leverage Becker’s time allocation theory to examine consumer demand and market competition for time-intensive goods. The Beckerian model predicts higher diversion ratios for goods with substantial time shares and those with high time costs relative to monetary prices. Applying this model to data from two field experiments, we analyze demand for Facebook and Instagram, focusing on substitution patterns across online activities and offline time use. Our findings indicate that users exhibit low elasticity to ad load, the primary user cost, and that time shares and time costs significantly influence diversion ratios. We explore the implications for user costs and benefits on these platforms and assess the potential impact of a Federal Trade Commission-proposed de-merger of Facebook and Instagram.

**[The United States as an Active Industrial Policy Nation](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34744)**

**Authors**: Jiandong Ju, Yuankun Li, Shang-Jin Wei

**Abstract**: We document and characterize a new history of U.S. federal-level industrial policies by scanning all 12,167 Congressional Acts and 6,030 Presidential Orders from 1973 through 2022. We find several interesting patterns. First, contrary to a common perception, the United States has always been an active industrial policy nation throughout the period, regardless of which party is in power, with 5.4 laws and 3.4 Presidential Orders per year on average containing new industrial policies. Second, we identify roughly 300% more instances of industrial policies than those in the Global Trade Alert (GTA) database during 2008-2022, despite using essentially the same definition. Third, industrial policies in practice are as likely to be justified by national security as by economic competitiveness. Fourth, many U.S. industrial policies incorporate design features that help mitigate potential drawbacks, such as explicit expiration dates and pilot programs for emerging technologies. Finally, based on stock market reactions and firm performance, the identified policies are recognized as economically significant in shifting resource allocations.

**[Behavioral Economics of AI: LLM Biases and Corrections](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34745)**

**Authors**: Pietro Bini, Lin William Cong, Xing Huang, Lawrence J. Jin

**Abstract**: Do generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), exhibit systematic behavioral biases in economic and financial decisions? If so, how can these biases be mitigated? Drawing on the cognitive psychology and experimental economics literatures, we conduct the most comprehensive set of experiments to date—originally designed to document human biases—on prominent LLM families across model versions and  scales. We document systematic patterns in LLM behavior. In preference-based tasks, responses become more human-like as models become more advanced or larger, while in belief-based tasks, advanced large-scale models frequently generate rational responses. Prompting LLMs to make rational decisions reduces biases.

**[Scaling Sustainable Investing in Emerging and Developing Economies: Frictions and Opportunities](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34746)**

**Authors**: Caroline Flammer, Thomas Giroux, Geoffrey Heal

**Abstract**: Mobilizing private capital at scale is critical for financing sustainable development, particularly in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), where capital is most needed. We conduct a global survey of senior investment decision-makers across a broad spectrum of capital providers, including asset managers, pension and sovereign wealth funds, development finance institutions, philanthropic investors, and others. The survey provides novel evidence on investors’ risk-return expectations, risk perceptions, and investment practices in EMDEs and in blended finance structures. We document four main findings. First, conditional on investor type, return expectations in EMDEs are comparable to those in developed markets, suggesting that categorical exclusions of EMDE assets might be inefficient. Second, investors’ dominant risk perceptions—particularly currency and political risks—are poorly aligned with the de-risking tools commonly employed in blended finance. Third, prevailing approaches to evaluating blended finance rely on both input- and outcome-based metrics, yet with limited measurement of financial and impact additionality. Fourth, our results highlight organizational and informational frictions, rather than unattractive financial fundamentals, as key barriers to scaling sustainable investing in EMDEs.

**[Effective and Scalable Programs to Facilitate Labor Market Transitions for Women in Technology](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34750)**

**Authors**: Susan Athey, Emil Palikot

**Abstract**: We evaluate two interventions facilitating technology-sector transitions for women in Poland: Mentoring, focused on expanding professional networks, and Challenges, focused on building credible skill signals. Randomizing oversubscribed admissions, we find both programs substantially increase technology employment at twelve months-by 15 percentage points for Mentoring and 11 p.p. for Challenges. The distinct mechanisms through which the programs operate translate to heterogeneous treatment effects across geography, career stage, and baseline credentials. These differential effects create scope for improved allocation: algorithmic targeting across programs outperforms random assignment by 86% and outperforms experts' selection into Mentoring by 11%.

**[A Few Bad Apples? Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34747)**

**Authors**: Zhuang Liu, Wenwei Peng, Shaoda Wang

**Abstract**: Honesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.

**Abstract**: Traditional valuation metrics for the U.S. stock market based on a comparison of the aggregate market value of U.S. corporations to measures of dividends, earnings, output, and the replacement cost of measured capital have been above historical norms for the past 25–30 years. Will they return to their historical means? We use macroeconomic data to argue that the observed decline in labor’s share of corporate output in conjunction with relatively weak corporate investment mechanically generates a persistent rise in the ratio of corporate valuation relative to corporate earnings, even absent any changes in expected returns or growth rates.

**[Industrial Activity, State Capacity, and Deforestation: Evidence from Brazil](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34751)**

**Authors**: Daniel Da Mata, Mario Dotta, Edson R. Severnini

**Abstract**: Does industrial activity drive deforestation and land degradation, and can limited state capacity be overcome to decouple economic growth from environmental harm? We examine these questions in the context of slaughterhouse plant openings in Brazil from 1994 to 2019. Guided by a simple conceptual framework and using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that plant openings increase livestock production while reducing forest cover and degrading pastureland. However, following the introduction of legally enforceable, incentive-compatible agreements between slaughterhouses and federal prosecutors—which penalize purchases of livestock from illegally deforested areas but act as a green certification mechanism—plant openings increase productivity without driving deforestation. Our findings suggest that tying firm performance to environmental goals through market-aligned legal mechanisms can generate economic and environmental gains at low cost to the government.

**[The Response of Debtors to Rate Changes](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34752)**

**Authors**: Andreas Fuster, Virginia Gianinazzi, Andreas Hackethal, Philip Schnorpfeil, Michael Weber

**Abstract**: How borrowers respond to future changes in the interest rate on their debt matters for the transmission of monetary policy and for household financial stability. Combining bank data, a letter RCT, and a survey, we study this question in the context of the German mortgage market, where since 2022 borrowers have faced high interest rates when their rate fixation period ends. We find that borrower actions substantially reduce the impact of higher rates on monthly payments. Survey responses corroborate high informedness and a strong propensity to prepare for rate changes. The letter intervention does not affect rate beliefs but increases awareness of available options and refinancing among borrowers close to expiration of their rate fixation.

**[Gender Norms and the Labor Market](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34716)**

**Authors**: Patricia Cortés, Jisoo Hwang, Jessica Pan, Uta Schönberg

**Abstract**: Despite substantial convergence in men’s and women’s economic roles, gender gaps in labor market outcomes persist across countries. This article provides a unified framework for understanding how gender norms shape economic behavior, distinguishing between internalized norms—preferences and beliefs tied to gender identity—and external norms arising from peer pressure and social coordination. We first document cross-country and within-country variation in gender attitudes, alongside gradual but uneven shifts toward more egalitarian views. We then review empirical evidence on the origins, persistence, and transmission of gender norms, and their effects on human capital accumulation, labor supply, wages, and policy take-up. The review highlights both the durability of gender norms and the mechanisms through which policies, institutions, and media can induce norm change, with implications for the design of effective interventions.

**[Global Imbalances and Power Imbalances](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34717)**

**Authors**: Christopher Clayton, Matteo Maggiori, Jesse Schreger

**Abstract**: We discuss the conditions under which global imbalances, such as China being a large foreign creditor and the United States being a large foreign debtor, might also generate power imbalances. We highlight possible theoretical channels and empirical measures that the future literature could investigate in a full treatment of this topic.

**[Structural Change and Jobless Development](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34718)**

**Authors**: Franziska L. Ohnsorge, Richard Rogerson, Zoe Xie

**Abstract**: Benchmark models of structural transformation focus on the reallocation of employment across sectors while assuming that overall employment stays constant. We show that this assumption does not match facts for developing economies. We study a panel of 48 mostly developing economies over the period 1990--2018 and document a strong positive relationship between the share of the population employed in agriculture and the overall employment rate. That is, the early part of the development process is associated with a substantial decline in the total employment rate. Motivated by this finding, we extend a benchmark model of structural change featuring Stone-Geary preferences to allow for endogenous labor supply. We show that this model can account for the patterns we document in the data both qualitatively and quantitatively. We use a calibrated version of our model to study the employment dynamics in several developing economies and show that structural change is a quantitatively important source of employment changes during the early stages of development.

**[Financial Crises: History, Theory and New Insights](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34719)**

**Authors**: Eric Hilt

**Abstract**: This review essay discusses the history, causes and consequences of financial crises. In recent years scholars have assembled new sources of data and utilized new empirical designs to analyze crises, shedding light on old questions and producing new insights. This essay highlights those new insights, and uses the historical record of crises in the United States to put those insights into perspective. I begin with a discussion of the defining characteristics of financial crises and their evolution, both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world. I then revisit the chronology of crises in the U.S. since 1870. Data on bank failure rates and large-bank equity losses suggest that some panics were not full-blown financial crises, and also identify episodes when no panic occurred that could potentially be considered crises. I then turn to two categories of theoretical models developed to analyze the mechanisms responsible for crises. The first focuses on asset price bubbles, which have been associated with many crises. The second is focused on the dynamics of bank runs and panics, which have been especially common in the United States. Finally, I present an overview of the effects of crises and the mechanisms transmitting financial distress in the banking system into the rest of the economy.

**[Modeling the Labor Implications of the Energy Transition](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34723)**

**Authors**: Marc A.C. Hafstead, Roberton C. Williams III

**Abstract**: The energy transition away from fossil fuels toward alternative energy sources will, like every significant economic transition, disrupt existing economic relationships and markets. Disruption in the labor market is of particular concern due to the distributional and political importance of energy jobs and the potential concentration of risks on workers in carbon-intensive sectors and regions that are particularly reliant on fossil-fuel industries. We look at modeling the labor implications of the energy transition. We outline a conceptual framework for analyzing the labor-market risks, focusing on obstacles to labor-market adjustments during the transition. We then review empirical research on such barriers to labor-market adjustments, with a focus on evidence that can inform modeling efforts. We also survey the literature on ex-ante modeling of the effects of the energy transition on labor markets, identifying both the challenges and opportunities for new research in this field.

**[Speculative Growth and the AI "Bubble"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34722)**

**Authors**: Ricardo J. Caballero

**Abstract**: AI technology can generate speculative-growth equilibria. These are rational but fragile: elevated valuations support rapid capital accumulation, yet persist only as long as beliefs remain coordinated. Because AI capital is labor-like, it expands effective labor and dampens the normal decline in the marginal product of capital as the capital stock grows. The gains from this expansion accrue disproportionately to capitalists, whose saving rate rises with wealth, raising aggregate saving.  Building on Caballero et al (2006), I show that these features generate a funding feedback—rising capitalist wealth lowers the required return—that can produce multiple equilibria. With intermediate adjustment costs, elevated valuations are the mechanism that sustains a transition toward a high-capital equilibrium; a loss of confidence can precipitate a self-fulfilling crash and reversal.

**[Understanding Latin America’s Fertility Decline: Age, Education, and Cohort Dynamics](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34749)**

**Authors**: Milagros Onofri, Inés Berniell, Raquel Fernández, Azul Menduiña

**Abstract**: This paper examines the sharp decline in fertility across Latin America using both period and cohort measures. Combining Vital Statistics, Census microdata, and UN population data, we decompose changes in fertility by age, education, and joint age–education groups. We show that the decline in period fertility between 2000 and 2022 is driven primarily by reductions in within-group birth rates rather than by changes in population composition, with the largest contributions coming from younger and less-educated women. Comparing the cohort born in the mid 1950s and the one born in the mid 1970s, we find that the decline in completed fertility reflects not only delayed childbearing but also substantial reductions in the average number of children per woman. This is driven primarily by lower fertility among mothers rather than by rising childlessness. Our findings provide new evidence on the nature of Latin America’s transition to below-replacement fertility and highlight several open questions for future research.

**[Psychology and Development: Applications from Cognitive and Social Psychology](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34753)**

**Authors**: Emily Breza, Supreet Kaur

**Abstract**: We outline a research agenda for behavioral development economics that seeks to understand the role of psychological channels in: (i) impeding individuals' ability to climb out of poverty, and (ii) shaping the organization of production, functioning of markets, and role of informal institutions in developing countries.  We apply a missing markets lens to rationalize why tools, products and services that help individuals overcome their biases will be under-supplied by the market and why behavioral biases can have large impacts in steady state, even among highly experienced agents. We argue that these biases are especially likely to matter for the field of development because core features of poverty---proximity to subsistence, high volatility,  market failures,  weak formal institutions, and reliance on social ties---amplify the impact of psychological constraints. We organize our review around a core set of psychological constructs: self-control, cognitive constraints, self-beliefs, mental health, and social norms. For each construct, we highlight places where there is only a proof of concept versus evidence of meaningful impacts, and the resultant implications for future research. We also highlight where social capital can be deployed to mitigate the impacts of missing markets. The field research to date has only begun to scratch the surface in document how psychological mechanisms affect behavior and decision-making, and substantial scope remains for future work to determine whether these constraints play a first-order role in shaping poverty.

**[Current Account Deficits and the Welfare of Future Generations](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34740)**

**Authors**: Christopher Phelan

**Abstract**: This paper explores the effects of one nation's  taxation of consumption on the welfare of future generations of other countries. To do this, it presents an otherwise standard one-good, two-country optimal growth model with free capital markets, but where each date represents the lifetime of a generation which cares not only about its own consumption and leisure, but also that of its descendants. Relative to a no tax benchmark, a policy of one country taxing consumption of its initial generations has ambiguous welfare effects for future generations of the other country, as long as those future generations are not too far in the future.   Higher initial savings in the first country raises capital levels, and thus wages, in both countries, raising welfare of future generations in the second country, but also induces lower bequests in the second country, lowering the welfare of its future generations.  In the long run, or for generations born near the steady state, the welfare effects of the first country inducing lower consumption of its initial generations are unambiguous: future generations of the second country are made worse off.  Households born in the second country will regret that their ancestors allowed such policy-induced intertemporal trade.

**[Missing Black Men? The Impact of Non-Reporting on Estimates of Labor Market Outcomes for Black Men](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34724)**

**Authors**: Adrienne Sabety, Ariella K. Spitzer

**Abstract**: Adult Black men persistently do not report to household-based surveys, with demographers estimating non-reporting rates of 7-14% from 1970-2020. We derive a method to account for incomplete data and show that non-reporting rates are up to 5.5 percentage points (pp) larger than prior estimates, with significant heterogeneity by year. We then show that Black men at risk of incarceration drive non-reporting. We use state-year variation in incarceration rates to estimate that 35-83% of the incarcerated population would have been non-reporting if not incarcerated. Adjusting for previously uncorrected non-reporting shows that the Black-white gap in high-school completion is 20-39% (3.0-5.9 pp) larger, college attendance is 8-18% (3.1-6.1 pp) larger, and earnings is 10-20% (2.8-5.7 pp) larger. In contrast, the gap in  employment is 4-8% (0.6-1.6 pp) smaller than previously thought.

**[Migration and the Making of the English Middle Class](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34721)**

**Authors**: Vasiliki Fouka, Theo Serlin

**Abstract**: When do people identify with their class? Evidence from social psychology shows that individuals are more likely to identify with a group if they are similar to its members. We study early 20th century Britain and show that regional cultural heterogeneity combined with internal migration influenced class identity. We develop and validate a measure of class identity using naming decisions. Exploiting within-household variation, we show that migration patterns that increased the local share of culturally-distant workers reduced working class identification. Where migration increased the cultural distance of the working class, workers were less likely to join unions, voters were less likely to support the nascent Labour Party, and parliamentary candidates were less likely to target working class voters. By 1911, slower in-migration and rising local population growth reduced working class distance in urban areas, which also became strongholds of support for Labour. Migration alters social identity and creates political cleavages.

**[You Only Live Twice: Financial Inflows and Growth in a Westward-Facing Ukraine](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34715)**

**Authors**: Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Maurice Obstfeld

**Abstract**: The monumental task of rebuilding postwar Ukraine requires early planning and identification of growth strategies. The earlier accession of Eastern European countries to the European Union and NATO offers a template that relies on massive foreign direct investment and public structural funds. This approach helps to raise incomes directly and can create a virtuous circle where capital deepening facilitates technological upgrades and repatriation of war refugees, which in turn stimulate more investment. We show theoretically that the government can refine this strategy by internalizing positive externalities from having a higher capital stock: Investment in physical capital relaxes borrowing constraints (thus allowing more capital inflows) and raises wages (thus encouraging more Ukrainian refugees to return home).
